            <h3>Is your TV an eyesore? Samsung wants to change that</h3>
            <h4>by Jack Regan</h4>

            <p>TVs are boring.</p>

            <p>It wasn't that long ago that we were all upgrading from tubes to flat panels, from square to wide screens. Every year brought bigger and thinner models with higher resolutions.</p>

            <p>Today, we've plateaued. Manufacturers have tried to keep innovating. But technologies like 3D and curved displays have yet to gain any real traction.</p>

            <p>For many shoppers, a $4,000 top-of-the-line model is indistinguishable from the $250 option at <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/televisions-video/1060825"> WalMart.</a></p>

            <p>And at least one TV maker seems to have noticed. With Samsung's new Frame TV, the company is taking things in a different direction.</p>

            <p>As the name implies, the Frame is designed to look like a framed piece of art hung on your wall. Until you turn it on.</p>

            <p>People arrange entire rooms around a TV that, when turned off, is just an ugly black rectangle. Samsung has designed a TV meant to blend in. They've embraced the boring.</p>

            <p>Until you see one in person, it's hard to describe just how well the Frame does blend. When the television is "off," the matte-finished screen is filled with art. It comes with 100 free options -- from colorful abstract patterns to stark black and whites. You can also buy more right from the TV itself ($19.99 apiece or $4.99 a month to subscribe to the entire collection) or upload your own.</p>

            <p>The Frame also gives you the choice of three, well, frames. By default, the television has black edges. But you can snap on a white, walnut or beige wood frame to best match your home decor. Each will set you back an additional $200 to $250.</p>

            <p>By some strange magic, the illusion works. I'm not sure if it's the artwork Samsung chose, or the overall design, but the first time I saw the Frame, I could have sworn I even saw the texture of the paint. It really does seem real.</p>

            <p>The Frame became available in the U.S. last month and will set you back $2,000 for the 55-inch model or $2,800 for the 65-inch.</p>

            <p>At those prices, it's clearly still meant for high-end buyers. But they will undoubtedly come down. And when that happens, designs like these could be the future of TVs -- a world where the screen is there when you need it and gone when you don't.</p>

            <h3>Silicon Valley investor resigns after harassment allegations</h3>
            <h4>by Sara Ashley O'Brien</h4>
            <figure><img id="left" src="../images/dave.jpg" alt="dave mcclure"></figure>
            <time datetime="2017-07-17T16:10-06:00"> 4:10 PM CST, July 17th, 2017</time>

            <p>Silicon Valley investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/topic/person/dave-mcclure/"> Dave McClure</a> has resigned from 500 Startups, the firm he cofounded.</p>

            <p>It comes on the heels of a New York Times report on Friday that he'd acted inappropriately toward Sarah Kunst, who was seeking a job at 500 Startups, in 2014. According to the Times, McClure, 51, sent Kunst a Facebook message that read, "I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you."</p>

            <p>On Friday after the story broke, 500 Startups cofounder Christine Tsai wrote that the firm had been aware of McClure's "inappropriate interactions with women in the tech community." As a result, leadership changes were made "a few months ago," with Tsai stepping in as CEO and McClure limiting his role to general partner, Tsai wrote.</p>

            <p>Saturday, McClure admitted that he'd "made advances toward multiple women in work-related situations, where it was clearly inappropriate. He said he was attending counseling to work on his behavior. "I don't expect anyone to believe I will change, but I'm working on it."</p>

            <p>But some of the firm's backers went public with their concerns over how the situation was handled.</p>

            <p>Mitch Kapor, an early limited partner in 500 Startups, tweeted on Friday, "We too found out in the NYT. Not good." In a separate tweet, he said he'd see if he could get some of his money back. Kapor did not respond to request for comment.</p>

            <p>Another limited partner, Matthew Papakipos, called for McClure to be removed as the general partner of 500 Startups. "No more $$ from me. Pls spread the word," he tweeted on Sunday.</p>

            <p>After the news of McClure's resignation, Mitch and Freada Kapor issued a joint statement.</p>

            <blockquote>"The events of 2017 in the tech ecosystem depict a sector gone deeply awry. This is not just a case of a few bad actors," they wrote. "This is a culture that has been allowed to fester and to rot by enablers who refused to intervene when they witnessed inexcusable behavior or went to great lengths to avoid seeing it."</blockquote>

            <p>The Kapors said they'll be engaged as LPs to ensure the "underrepresented founders, partners and employees of 500 Startups are able to go forward with their work."</p>

            <h3>Elon Musk promises world's biggest lithium ion battery to Australia</h3>
            <h4>by Sherisse Pham</h4>

            <p>Elon Musk is following through on his promise to solve an energy crisis in Australia.</p>

            <p>His electric car company, Tesla (TSLA), has teamed up with a French renewable energy firm and an Australian state government to install the world's largest <a href="https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory">lithium ion battery.</a></p>

            <p>Paired up with a wind farm in the state of South Australia, the battery will be three times more powerful than the next biggest in the world, Musk said at a news conference in the city of Adelaide on Friday.</p>

            <blockquote>"If South Australia's willing to take a big risk, then so are we," he said.</blockquote>

            <p>The announcement comes after billionaire entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes threw down the gauntlet to Musk in March, asking if Tesla was serious when it claimed it could quickly end blackouts in South Australia.</p>

            <blockquote>"Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?" Musk wrote on Twitter at the time.</blockquote>

            <h3>Introducing the WhyPhone 6: An iPhone-Shaped Piece of Plastic for Mobile Online Addicts </h3>
            <h4>By Levon Hold</h4>
            <figure><img id="left" src="../images/whyphone3x4.png" alt="why phone"></figure>
            <time datetime="2017-07-15T21:15-06:00"> 9:15 PM CST, July 15th, 2017</time>
            <p>If you’re worried about your smartphone addiction, then the new WhyPhone might be just what you need. It’s the perfect mobile placebo – it looks and feels exactly like an iPhone, but it does nothing. It’s just a piece of plastic that you carry around in your hand to fool yourself.</p>

            <p>With a thin, light and completely wireless design, the WhyPhone acts as a surrogate to any smart mobile device, enabling you to always have a rectangle of smooth, cold plastic to clutch without forgoing any potential engagement with your direct environment.</p>

            <blockquote>“Phone addiction is real,” says developer Ima Luddite. "It’s ruining your dates. It’s distracting you at concerts. It’s enabling your drunk texting. It’s clogging up our sidewalks."</blockquote>

            <p>The WhyPhone is 5.5 inches high, 2.6 inches wide and 0.29 inches thick, bringing it quite close to the latest iPhone 6. It is shatterproof and waterproof. It offers infinite battery life. And it comes with a license offering free software upgrades for the life of the phone.</p>

            <p>For those interested in WhyPhone, but concerned about no longer being able to take nude selfies, WhyPhone is available with an optional <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/24-x60-Silver-Black-Plating-Mirror-Vinyl-Wrap-Sticker-Decal-Sheet-w-Air-Bubble-Free/950025450">mirror sticker</a> so you can enjoy ‘real-time’ selfies with your friends when they’re standing right behind you.</p>
