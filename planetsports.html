            <h3>Mets' Noah Syndergaard Explains Rehab Process, Timeline for Return</h3>
            <h4>by Joe Giglio</h4>
            <figure><img id="left" src="../images/noah.jpg" alt="noah syndergaard"></figure>
            <time datetime="2017-07-19T21:00-06:00"> 9:00 PM CST, July 19th, 2017</time>
            <p>NEW YORK -- The path back to the mound began for <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31730/noah-syndergaard">Noah Syndergaard</a> on Monday afternoon at Citi Field.</p>

            <p>The Mets ace played catch in the outfield with fellow injured rotation mate Matt Harvey.</p>

            <p>Shortly after what manager Terry Collins described as "day one" for an eventual return to the bump, Syndergaard opened up about the throwing session, rehab and timeline for recovery.</p>

            <blockquote>"First couple throws felt a little weird," Syndergaard said when asked how it felt to toss the ball with Harvey. "Almost like a ping pong ball in my hand."</blockquote>

            <p>So what's next after throwing a baseball at Citi Field?</p>

            <blockquote>"I don't need to rush it back," Syndergaard said about regaining comfort with the ball. "Felt good. Going to take it day by day from here on out."</blockquote>

            <p>With a partial tear to his lat muscle, the strong right-handed pitcher had to modify his intense workout routine to protect the injured area. That's led to emphasising different areas of his body to make sure he's prepared for a return.</p>

            <blockquote>"I'm able to modify my leg workouts," Syndergaard said. "I don't want any flare ups with the lat. Rotator cuff strengthening. A lot of work on the bike. My body has never felt better."</blockquote>

            <p>As far as when a possible return to a playoff push could commence?</p>

            <blockquote>"No timeline yet," Syndergaard said after acknowledging that today could be like the first day of spring training all over again. "Taking things day by day. Slowly build up arm strength up. I've been pain and symptom free for about a month now."</blockquote>

            <p>Based on Syndergaard's state of his body and Collins' description of what Monday was for his ace, a return sometime in mid-to-late August seems like the best possible outcome for the Mets right now.</p>

            <h3>What do the Eagles expect from Carson Wentz in 2017?</h3>
            <h4>by Eliot Shorr-Parks</h4>
            <figure><img id="right" src="../images/carson.jpg" alt="carson wentz"></figure>
            <time datetime="2017-07-17T8:30-06:00"> 8:30 AM CST, July 17th, 2017</time>
            <p>Expectations outside of the NovaCare Complex for Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz this season are very high.</p>

            <p>It is assumed he will take a big step forward in his second season, with very few couching those expectations with the possibility that he won't take a gigantic leap forward.</p>

            <p>Inside of the NovaCare Complex, however, the Eagles are trying to temper what is expected of Wentz in just his second season.</p>

            <blockquote>"We want to see an incremental growth," head coach Doug Pederson said earlier this offseason. "I mean obviously a lot of it comes down to how well we as coaches, myself, prepare him for games."</blockquote>

            <p>Wentz's rookie season in 2016 was very encouraging to almost anybody that watched him. Despite being thrown in as a starter just a week before the first game of the season, Wentz showed plenty of flashes of what made him the No. 2 overall pick.</p>

            <p>New Eagles receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/14912/alshon-jeffery">Alshon Jeffery</a> is one of the most interesting players to debate on the team.</p>

            <p>Still, when things were all said and done, Wentz finished with just 16 touchdowns in 16 games -- and threw 14 interceptions.</p>

            <p>Part of the reason for Wentz's poor play at times could be the Eagles had him throw the ball 607 times, an extremely high number for any quarterback, but especially a rookie.</p>

            <p>With so many new weapons around him, it is fair to expect Wentz to finish with more than 16 touchdowns. He likely won't throw the ball 607 times again, but even with a slightly decreased workload, it is clear Pederson is still counting on using a -- hopefully -- improved Wentz to take the offense a big step forward this season. </p>

            <blockquote>"I don't want to keep a box on him. I don't want to keep a lid on him. He thinks a lot like I do, sort of out-of-the-box thinkers, which is good to have. He's creative," Pederson said. "And so just understanding the overall structure of the offense, the plays and situational football, he'll be so much better in those areas that you'll see incremental increases and incremental growth in his play this year just by observing that."</blockquote>

            <h3>N.J. native finishes as top American at U.S. Women's Open</h3>
            <h4>By Matt Stypulkoski</h4>

            <p>BEDMINSTER - Marina Alex knows she's on the cusp of breaking through.</p>

            <p>In fact, just 10 players stood between the girl who grew up in Wayne and the U.S. Women's Open trophy.</p>

            <p>But even without the win, Alex still walked away from <a href="http://www.trumpnationalwestchester.com/">Trump National Golf Club </a>with plenty: the top-American title, $105,268.50 and the invaluable experience of being in contention at a major.</p>

            <blockquote>"It's great," Alex said. "Last time I had a top 10 in a major was my first year out here (in the 2014) British Open, but this is awesome. This is really - I feel like I've improved so much from then till now in terms of my game and just nice to be back close to the lead."</blockquote>

            <p>Unfortunately for Alex, a six-hole stretch of five-over-par golf to start her Saturday round took her out of contention. But the 26-year-old recovered down the stretch, recording 30 bogey-free holes to close out the tournament at 4-under.</p>

            <blockquote>"I'm really incredibly happy with that at a U.S. Open," Alex said. "That's kind - that's pretty impressive, honestly, to not drop a shot."</blockquote>

            <h3>A chic geek sport emerges for the smart, pudgy, pale, and rich.</h3>
            <h4>By Ivan Youloos</h4>
            <figure><img id="right" src="../images/segwaypolo.jpg" alt="segway polo"></figure>
            <time datetime="2017-07-15T11:00-06:00"> 11:00 AM CST, July 15th, 2017</time>
            <p>What do billionaire geeks do for sport? They play polo. On segways.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_polo">Segway polo</a> works a lot like regular polo, except instead of riding horses, the players are on Segways, and instead of evoking glamorous images of a centuries-old aristocratic tradition, the players are on Segways. Billed as the invention that would change the course of mankind when it was unveiled in 2001, the Segway has instead fallen into more of a niche market, used primarily for tour groups and the tech-obsessed.</p>

            <p>The sport has begun to take off--or at least roll slowly apparently defying gravity--growing from an eight-team local bay area tournament to a World Cup. The Segway Polo World Cup features nine teams from five countries—Germany, Sweden, the United States, Lebanon, and Barbados.</p>

            <p>The winner receives a trophy called the Woz Cup, in honor of the sport's creator, former Apple computer guru Steve Wozniak. "I'll be honest, when I saw the Segway was invented I thought, 'Wow, this will make lazy people lazier,'" admits Jennifer Sandserson, the World Cup coordinator. But she has been won over by the intensive action and abject violence.</p>

            <p>Segway polo players do typically gentlemanly things like "wear white pants." But it's also deceptively violent. Ramming is illegal, but nonetheless fairly common, and when it happens it can lead to grisly injuries like compound fractures. A collision in Segway polo is tantamount to a low-speed car crash, with little more than a helmet to protect you. But if Segway Polo has the violence of traditional sports, its appeal is still limited to the select group of people who already own Segways.</p>
