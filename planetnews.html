                <h3>Man Convicted of Driving Zamboni Drunk at Hockey Game</h3>

                <time datetime="2017-07-18T19:15-06:00"> 7:15 PM CST, July 18th, 2017</time>
                <p>A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1DUAbAJsdg">Zamboni</a> during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer's argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn't meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.</p>

                <p>Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state's 24/7 sobriety program.</p>

                <p>He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.</p>

                <p>Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles "such as" a Zamboni.</p>

                <p>Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni.</p>

                <p>Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. "I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life," he said.</p>

                <p>New Jersey officials smell something fishy. There have been some incredible animal rescues from the elements, but the <a href="https://www.newarknj.gov/departments/healthcommunitywellness">City of Newark's Department of Health and Community Wellness</a> warned New Jerseyans today not to catch or eat fish that may have scavanged after the recent storms.</p>

                <p>In Newark, heavy rain and flooding has caused fish to swim out of overflown rivers. Some locals are placing them back to their homes while others see this as an opportunity for dinner.</p>

                <p>Department of Health spokeswoman Elle R. Highwater told reporters, "Hey. These are New Jersey rivers. Would you drink the water out of these rivers? If not, why would you eat fish that drink that water?"</p>

                <p>Police say a belligerent man dressed in scuba gear caused a stir at a Traverse City, Michigan McDonalds restaurant when he waddled up to the drive-thru window and tried to order a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/filet-o-fish.html">filet-o-fish sandwich.</a></p>

                <p>The Traverse City Record-Eagle reports when man, who had been drinking like a marlin, showed up Tuesday morning workers called police. Officers found the 48-year-old man a quarter mile down the pike flipping off passing drivers. Captain Crook of the Traverse City PD says the man was tanked. He was not arrested, but warned not to surface again at the restaurant.</p>

                <p>Crook couldn't fathom why the man was wearing scuba gear.</p>

                <p>Troopers don't always stop people in the HOV lanes, but when they do, they prefer at least 'dos' passengers.</p>

                <p>A motorcycle trooper parked along Interstate 5 near <a href="http://www.cityoftacoma.org/">Tacoma</a> on Monday afternoon spotted a driver and a rather unusual "passenger" pass by him in the carpool lane. When the trooper stopped the car, he discovered the "passenger" was a cardboard cutout of the actor who portrays "The Most Interesting Man in the World" in Dos Equis beer ads. Washington State Patrol Trooper Tony Brock says it's by far the best high occupancy vehicle lane scam he's seen, but it lacked depth.</p>

                <p>The driver's response when confronted? "I don't always take the Interstate to work, but when I do I use the HOV lane." Hopefully, that earned him an additional fine.</p>
